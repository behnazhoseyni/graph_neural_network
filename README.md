# graph_neural_network<br>
i am studing GNN and it's applications of molecular science and Drug design. <br>
for this gole i need Bioinformatics knowledge.<br>
very data in real world have graph structure, then we need knowledge of graphs and graph deep neural network.<br>
for graph knowledge read [introduction to graph theory](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/~v1ranick/papers/wilsongraph.pdf) is very usefull.<br>
